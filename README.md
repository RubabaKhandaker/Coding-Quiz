This is a coding quiz I have built that showcases some of the core skills I have learned in week 4 of the MONU coding bootcamp.

## Usage

Click "Start Quiz" button to begin playing through the quiz. For each answer chosen incorrectly, the timer will go down by 10 seconds. The end score will be the the remaining time you have left in the countdown once you have answered the last question. You will then be able to type in your intials into an input box and save your score, as well as view scores of the past.

To view the source code of the webpage, open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the source code of the webpage.
